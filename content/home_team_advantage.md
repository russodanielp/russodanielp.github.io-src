Summary: I don't know how, but at some point in my life I got it in my head that baseball does not have a significant advantage for the home team. I had heard there were sports where it plays a huge part (the NFL for example) but it was all hearsay. Baseball for me just always felt immune to it. I guess when even the best teams have winning percentages barely over .500 through 162 games, there was an air of randomness for any given baseball game.
