Summary: Molecule properties and activities are most often represented in continuous, real values (e.g., EC50, IC50, LD50, LogP, etc.). Usually for graphs I convert these values into discrete classifications (e.g., active/inactive, toxic/non-toxic, soluble/insoluble, etc.). When making a new graph I can represent a molecule's properties or activities using a set of a few colors (red for active, green for inactive, etc). Pretty straight forward stuff. However, if I wanted to color the compound's real value it'd be a little more difficult; I would need a color gradient. For example, the most active compounds the color would be red and the least active would be green. Molecules that fall inbetween would be a color that is a mix between red and green, more red for more active and vice versa.
