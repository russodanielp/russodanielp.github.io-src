Summary: Recently, I needed to make a heatmap with a dendrogram for work. The only libraries that I could find with that particular template were seaborn or plotly. However, I really like plotting with bokeh, and after stumbling upon this StackOverflow question, it seemed like no code was available. The more I program the more I find myself prefering to code graphs myself, so I decided to forgo using a high-level template and instead make my own. Here is a heatmap clustering the MLB teams by batting statistics.
