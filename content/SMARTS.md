Summary: SMiles ARbitrary Target Specification (SMARTS) is a language used for pattern searching in molecules. SMARTS takes its cue from regular expressions, which allow for character matching in text strings. Simply put, a sequence of characters in a regular expression defines a search pattern. For example, in a regular expression the vertical bar character, |, is boolean operator meaning "or". Using python's re.py module we can find matches.
